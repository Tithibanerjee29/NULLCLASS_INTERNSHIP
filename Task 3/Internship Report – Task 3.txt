Task Title: Sentiment Analysis Integration into Chatbot

📝 Objective
To integrate sentiment analysis into a chatbot to detect and respond appropriately to customer emotions during interactions. The chatbot should be able to classify user input into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments and respond with empathy and contextual appropriateness.

⚙️ Implementation Details
Tools & Libraries Used:

transformers library by Hugging Face

Pre-trained sentiment analysis pipeline (based on BERT)

Steps Followed:

Imported the sentiment analysis pipeline using pipeline("sentiment-analysis").

Created a function to analyze the user's input, detect the sentiment, and return a custom response.

Customized responses based on:

POSITIVE → Encouraging and supportive tone

NEGATIVE → Sympathetic and problem-solving tone

Neutral/Other → Professional and helpful tone

Developed the chatbot interface in both Python CLI and Jupyter Notebook for interactive testing.

🤖 Sample Code Snippet
python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import pipeline

# Load sentiment analysis model
sentiment_pipeline = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

# Define response logic
def generate_response(user_input):
    result = sentiment_pipeline(user_input)[0]
    sentiment = result['label']
    confidence = round(result['score'] * 100, 2)

    if sentiment == "POSITIVE":
        return f"😊 I'm really glad to hear that! (Confidence: {confidence}%) Is there anything else I can help with?"
    elif sentiment == "NEGATIVE":
        return f"🙁 I'm sorry to hear that. (Confidence: {confidence}%) Let’s work on making this better for you."
    else:
        return f"😐 Got it. (Confidence: {confidence}%) Let me know how I can assist further."
✅ Expected Outcome Achieved
✔️ The chatbot successfully detects sentiment from user messages.

✔️ It generates appropriate responses to match user emotions.

✔️ Enhanced user engagement through emotionally aware interaction.
